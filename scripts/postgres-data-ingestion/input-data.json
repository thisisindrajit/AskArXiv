All\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 19:18:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2007 20:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26","authors_parsed":[["Bal\u00e1zs","C.",""],["Berger","E.

An example is given for a\nthree-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are\nexamined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order\n(ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the\nside with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by\nODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition.

Here we explore\ndifferent aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and\nthe polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive\nthe polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory\nand show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the\nsecond part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse\nprocess in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back\nthe ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics.
